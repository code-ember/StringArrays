# Superhero Information Management

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of arrays and strings in Java to efficiently store and manage superhero information. It is designed as a learning exercise to reinforce foundational programming concepts. Through hands-on tasks, users will gain practical experience with arrays, string manipulation, and data validation.

## Features
1. **Print Superhero Names and Introduction Years**:
   - Utilize arrays to store superhero names and their introduction years.
   - Display all stored information using simple iteration.

2. **Modify Superhero Data**:
   - Edit superhero names in the `String` array.
   - Update corresponding introduction years in the `int` array.

3. **Validate Data Consistency**:
   - Ensure the length of the superhero name array matches the introduction year array to verify data integrity.

## Implementation Steps
### Step 1: Explore the Starter Code
- Analyze pre-defined `String` and `int` arrays containing superhero data.
- Understand how the arrays are structured for efficient access.

### Step 2: Display Superhero Data
- Print all superhero names stored in the `String` array.
- Print the corresponding introduction years from the `int` array.

**Expected Output:**
```
Superhero Names:
Batman
Superman
Wonder Woman
Spider-Man
Iron Man

Introduction Years:
1939
1938
1941
1962
1963
```

### Step 3: Modify Superhero Data
- Change the name of a superhero in the `String` array (e.g., replace "Wonder Woman" with "Thor").
- Update the corresponding year of introduction in the `int` array.

**Expected Output:**
```
Original superhero name at position 3: Wonder Woman
Modified superhero name at position 3: Thor
Original introduction year for superhero at position 3: 1941
Modified introduction year for superhero at position 3: 2011
```

### Step 4: Verify Array Lengths
- Compare the lengths of the `String` and `int` arrays to ensure consistency.
- Print the total count of elements in both arrays.

**Expected Output:**
```
Total superheroes in String array: 5
Total superheroes in int array: 5
```

## Conclusion
This project showcases the importance of arrays for managing collections of data and highlights how to manipulate and validate data efficiently. By completing this exercise, developers will strengthen their understanding of arrays and their practical applications in programming.

## Software Used
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Used as the integrated development environment for writing and executing Java code.
